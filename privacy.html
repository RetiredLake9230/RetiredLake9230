    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We want to make it clear that our App does not have access to the internet, and we do not collect any personal or sensitive information from you. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>

        <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> We do not track your interactions within the App or collect any usage analytics.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any information from you, there is no information for us to use. The App is designed to function without any internet connectivity or data collection.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our App does not integrate with any third-party services or APIs that may collect information. You can use our App with confidence, knowing that your privacy is fully respected.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
